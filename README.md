# Image-Tool
This repository contains an image tool that is created using Python along with Streamlit

## Features of the image tool are as listed below (operations the tool can perform):
1. Resize images based on size (this will change the size of the image, not the dimensions)
2. Update the image dimensions (limited options to create the dimensions, you made more)
3. Update opactiy of the image (by updating the opacity value)
4. Rotate the image as per your requirement (multiple options to select from, you can choose anyone)
5. Flip the image either horizontal or in vertical manner (only two options to select from, you can choose anyone)
6. Remove white background (only understands white color in the background, not very efficient, but helps in deleting the white pixels in the background)
7. Create a sketch (creates a pencil sketch of the image that is uploaded in the system)
8. Clear the data (you can clear all the data and work that you have done)

## Language Requirements
1. Python, Version 3.7.3 or above
2. Streamlit, Version 0.65.2 or above

## Pre-requisites libraries/packages
1. OpenCV (pip install opencv)
2. Python Imaging Library (pip install pil)
3. Numpy (pip install numpy)
4. Streamlit (pip install streamlit)

Note: Installation of these libraries will be requiring an internet connection

## Steps to run the code
1. Install all the libraires/packages as mentioned above
2. Open terminal in PyCharm or command prompt in windows/linux/mac (depending on your OS, the commands in the terminal will vary, please take a note of that)
3. Type the command, 'streamlit run filename.py'

Note: Here 'filename.py' is the name of the Python file that you create

## System used for running the code
This is to give you an idea about the system configuration
1. RAM 16GB DDR4
2. 256 GB SSD (make sure required space is available in your system in order to install the packages and run the code)
3. No dedicated GPU required
